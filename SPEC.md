## 1. Non-negotiable constraints

1. **No CocoaPods.** Dependencies come from Swift Package Manager, a local
   in-repo package, a vendored source folder, or nothing at all — per section 3.
2. **No shared code with other portfolio apps.** Business rules are re-implemented
   here under this app's own type names.
3. **All code, identifiers, comments, UI copy and the README are in English.**
4. **No launch gate, no WebView shell, no remote configuration, no analytics.**
   Guideline 4.2 (Minimum Functionality): this is a native SwiftUI product, not
   a web browsing experience. WKWebView / SFSafariViewController as UI is a
   reject. Push notifications, Core Location, and sharing do not make a
   browser or a thin catalog into an App Store app.
5. **Guideline 5.1.1 (Privacy):** never direct the user to grant camera access.
   A pre-permission screen may exist; the proceed button is **Continue** or
   **Next**, never "Allow camera", "Enable camera", "Grant camera", or a bare
   Allow/Enable that triggers `requestAccess`. The system alert is the only Allow.
6. **No CI files.** No `bitrise.yml`, no `Scripts/`, no `metadata/` folder.
7. **Assets are AI-generated.** No stock photography. SF Symbols may support
   small affordances but must never be the primary iconography.
8. **The app must build clean** with
   `xcodegen generate && xcodebuild -scheme Pirnbox -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build`.
9. **Nothing may echo another app in this batch** in naming, layout or visuals.
10. **This is not a calorie meal-slot tracker** unless family is `food_tracker`.
   Do not invent food logging to fill the brief.

## 2. Product core

The product is offline-first. No account, no sign-in, no ads, no in-app purchase,
no analytics SDK, no remote config. All user data stays on the device.

A home sewist taps today's glass bobbin to spend a thread unit and reloads it so remaining returns to capacity.

### 2.1 User flow

1. Tap the glass bobbin to spend one unit from remaining.
2. Watch remaining against capacity on the bobbin.
3. Reload the bobbin to restore remaining to capacity and file a ReloadMark.
4. Open Calendar as a sheet or deep link to see which days filed ReloadMarks.
5. Read Charts of stitches versus bobbin capacity.
6. Open History for Stitch order and ReloadMarks.
7. Edit Capacity on Settings.

### 2.2 Essential behaviour

- Home is the glass bobbin with remaining versus capacity as the live column.
- A tap writes one Stitch and spends 1 from Remaining.
- Reload writes a ReloadMark and sets Remaining to Capacity.
- A tap at Remaining 0 writes Bare and Remaining stays 0.
- Calendar, Charts, History and Settings arrive as sheets on the locked bobbin.
- Deep links and App Intents open Home, Calendar, Charts, History and Settings.
- Undo peels the last Stitch or the last ReloadMark.
- Settings sets integer Capacity.
- Local only; no catalog, no camera, no meal slots.

### 3.0 Product concept

This is the product the contracts below are assigned to. Do not substitute another.

**Family** — metric_capacity

**Core** — A home sewist taps today's glass bobbin to spend a thread unit and reloads it so remaining returns to capacity.

**Audience** — Home sewists who empty a bobbin mid-seam and want remaining thread on the glass, not a stitch diary.

**User flow**

1. Tap the glass bobbin to spend one unit from remaining.
2. Watch remaining against capacity on the bobbin.
3. Reload the bobbin to restore remaining to capacity and file a ReloadMark.
4. Open Calendar as a sheet or deep link to see which days filed ReloadMarks.
5. Read Charts of stitches versus bobbin capacity.
6. Open History for Stitch order and ReloadMarks.
7. Edit Capacity on Settings.

**Essential features**

- Home is the glass bobbin with remaining versus capacity as the live column.
- A tap writes one Stitch and spends 1 from Remaining.
- Reload writes a ReloadMark and sets Remaining to Capacity.
- A tap at Remaining 0 writes Bare and Remaining stays 0.
- Calendar, Charts, History and Settings arrive as sheets on the locked bobbin.
- Deep links and App Intents open Home, Calendar, Charts, History and Settings.
- Undo peels the last Stitch or the last ReloadMark.
- Settings sets integer Capacity.
- Local only; no catalog, no camera, no meal slots.

**Twist** — Stitch-then-reload. Home is the glass bobbin. A tap writes one Stitch and spends 1 from Remaining. Remaining starts at Capacity. A tap at Remaining 0 writes Bare and Remaining stays 0. Reload writes a ReloadMark and sets Remaining to Capacity. Reload while Remaining equals Capacity is a no-op. Retract peels the last Stitch and restores 1, or peels the last ReloadMark if that was the last write. There is no stitch-count field and no project-list field. Home verb: stitch-the-bobbin, not log-a-row. Calendar counts ReloadMarks. Charts compare stitches to Capacity. Settings sets Capacity. Deep links open Home, Calendar, Charts, History and Settings.

**Why this is not a repeat** — Family stays metric_capacity as the uniqueness-graph seed required, but the job is not another fill-up pair in five-tab chrome. Home is a locked glass bobbin: stitch spends remaining thread, reload files a ReloadMark and restores Remaining to Capacity, and a stitch at zero writes Bare without hanging an extra unit. That is not Waywiser click-up, not Withycreel overhang keep, not Castellum water vessels, not Diapason bellows Wind, and not a loom journal with swapped nouns. Calendar, Charts, History and Settings are sheets plus deep-link routes, so the free screens leftover is used without making the five family tabs the product. Scanner and search_api keep the seeded catalog values only; the binary does not scan or call Open Food Facts.

### 3.0a Craft from the shipped portfolio

Full craft is in KNOWLEDGE.md. Follow it. Do not copy type names or layouts.
- Home: Today metric vs capacity — only if you add a real second verb. Prefer another family.
- Invariant: If you must: one unit log, capacity formula, calendar. Do not ship the 5-tab chrome (Home/Calendar/History/Charts/Settings) as the uniqueness.
- Never: This family is a clone cluster. Pick a rare verb or a different family.
- Desk `watch_rate`: OLS s/day vs day; R²; DU/DD/CU/CL/CD spread; COSC |dev|≤4.
- Taste DNA is section 7.6. Do not invent a second look.

### 3.1 Architecture contract

The bobbin is a spend encoding: Remaining is an integer field, Capacity is a separate integer, and Remaining starts at Capacity rather than aliasing it. A Stitch writes Remaining minus one and Remaining floors at zero. A Stitch while Remaining is already zero writes Bare and leaves Remaining at zero, so a bare bobbin never hangs an extra unit. Reload writes a ReloadMark that stores remainingBefore and sets Remaining to Capacity; Reload while Remaining already equals Capacity is a no-op. Retract peels the last write on this bobbin: a Stitch restores one up to Capacity, a ReloadMark restores remainingBefore, and a Bare peels without changing Remaining. One BobbinStore owns the fold of Stitch, Bare, and ReloadMark keyed as Int YYYYMMDD from Calendar.current.startOfDay; views call stitch, reload, and retract; unit tests prove the spend, the floor, Bare at zero, reload restore, reload no-op at full, retract restore, and that Remaining never goes negative.

Put a short comment block at the top of each principal type stating the role it
plays in this architecture. The README must justify the pattern for this product.

### 3.2 UI contract

SwiftUI pure with the metriccapacity take-token: first of this family, so compose an original locked glass bobbin. Steal one unit log, a capacity formula, and a calendar of reloads only. Do not ship Home Calendar Charts History Settings as five equal tabs, and do not copy a rod grid, a stringer of clips, communicating vessels, a bellows canvas, or a loom journal. Stock SwiftUI only: NavigationStack, Button, List, Form, sheet, onOpenURL, App Intents. No UIViewRepresentable, no WKWebView, no Safari sheet, no TabView. Home is the mechanic: the glass bobbin fills remaining height and the iPad width; remaining versus capacity is the live thread column; a tap on the bobbin is Stitch. Conversation rhythm: soft header, remaining and capacity as speech cards of varying width, composer full width at the bottom for Reload and Retract. Confine custom drawing to that one bobbin hero (Shape, Path, Material glass); Calendar, Charts, History, and Settings are stock sheets. Primary ButtonStyle covers default, pressed, disabled, and loading; Stitch wears accent; Retract does not; Reload is not a destructive primary. Chrome lives inside the Button label with contentShape; min 44pt. Empty and onboarding are full pages with frame(maxHeight: .infinity) and a bottom full-width Continue or Next or Stitch. Background fills the safe area; lists use contentMargins.bottom. Reduce Motion instant-swaps; otherwise cross-fade 180ms ease-out and numbers tick. Colour is never the only Bare signal. One haptic on a successful stitch, reload, or retract; none on sheets, deep links, or App Intents.

### 3.3 Naming contract

Convention: Lockstitch / bobbin lexicon.

Examples to follow: `Bobbin`, `ReloadMark`, `stitch(_:)`, `Bare`

### 3.4 Dependency contract

Pirnbox ships no SPM packages and no vendored sources. project.yml has no packages key. Foundation and SwiftUI only. The leftover AVCaptureMetadataOutput scanner and cgi search pl endpoint stay unused; do not import AVFoundation for capture, do not request camera access, and do not call a remote catalog. SF Pro is the system face; do not bundle a font.

### 3.5 Navigation contract

Bobbin-locked chrome: Home never leaves. There is no TabView and no pushed record stack. Calendar, Charts, History, and Settings arrive as sheets over the glass bobbin; Close dismisses a sheet. Stitch fuses on the bobbin; Reload and Retract sit in the bottom composer and are not destinations. Deep links (pirnbox://home, pirnbox://calendar, pirnbox://charts, pirnbox://history, pirnbox://settings, and the matching https://pirnbox-bobbin.pro paths) and App Intents open those five surfaces: home dismisses sheets, the others present the named sheet. Contact URL https://pirnbox-bobbin.pro/contact-us lives on Settings. No Scan, Search, or Game chrome. After onboarding, read ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments once: ReviewScreen today stays on Home, log presents History, goals presents Settings. Skip onboarding on Simulator after the pnb.demo.v1 seed so the hook can fire.

### 3.6 Screen composition contract

Deep link routed screens · bobbin. Physical screens: Home, Calendar, Charts, History, Settings. Home is the locked glass bobbin with remaining versus capacity as the live column; a tap writes one Stitch; Reload and Retract sit in the bottom composer; ReviewScreen today. Home has no first-run empty because Remaining starts at Capacity and Stitch is live after onboarding. Calendar is a sheet of days that filed ReloadMarks (deep link calendar) with a full-page empty: generated cutout art, headline No reloads filed., one line Reload the bobbin to mark a day., full-width bottom Reload. Charts is a sheet that compares stitch counts to Capacity with stock Chart (deep link charts). History is a sheet of Stitch order, Bare, and ReloadMarks (ReviewScreen log) with a full-page empty: generated cutout art, headline Nothing stitched yet., one line Tap the bobbin to spend a unit., full-width bottom Stitch. Settings is a Form for integer Capacity, contact URL at https://pirnbox-bobbin.pro/contact-us, re-run onboarding, and resetAllData (ReviewScreen goals). Onboarding is a one-shot cover of three pages with Continue or Next at the bottom full width. No Today, Scan, Search, or Goals screens. ReviewScreen today log and goals must open three different screens.

Section 5 lists the logical functions that must exist. This section decides how
they are grouped into actual screens. Where the two disagree, this section wins.

---

## 4. Target file organization

Scheme: **By bobbin role (Bobbin, Stitch, Remaining, ReloadMark, Bare, Capacity)**

```
Pirnbox/
  Bobbin/
Stitch/
Remaining/
ReloadMark/
Bare/
Capacity/
  Assets.xcassets/
```

Adapt the leaf files to the architecture, but the top-level shape is fixed. Do
not create a `Utils/` or `Helpers/` dumping ground.

---

## 5. Screens

Build the screens named in section 3.6. The labels below are logical;
actual type names follow this app's naming convention.

### 5.1 Onboarding
Three to four pages. Explains the product, writes initial settings, sets a
completion flag. Skip still writes sensible defaults. Re-runnable from Settings.

### 5.2 Home
A first-class screen for **Home**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.3 Calendar
A first-class screen for **Calendar**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.4 Charts
A first-class screen for **Charts**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.5 History
A first-class screen for **History**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.6 Settings
A first-class screen for **Settings**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.7 Settings
Holds: re-run onboarding, reset all data (confirmed), and the contact link to
the domain contact-us URL.

### 5.8 Twist screen
See section 12. The twist needs at least one screen of its own plus a surface on the home screen.


---

## 6. Domain model

Minimum entities, named per this app's convention:

- **MetricRecord** — named per this app's convention.
- **CapacityRecord** — named per this app's convention.
- Plus whatever the twist in section 12 requires.


---

## 7. Design system

Direction: **Rose quartz calm**

### 7.1 Palette

| Token | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `background` | `#FBF9F4` | Screen background |
| `surface` | `#FEFEFD` | Cards, rows, sheets |
| `ink` | `#392F18` | Primary text and icons |
| `accent` | `#CC9719` | Primary action, key figure, progress fill |
| `muted` | `#80704D` | Secondary text, dividers, disabled |

Define these as named colours in `Assets.xcassets` and reach them through one
typed accessor. Never hard-code a hex string anywhere else.

### 7.2 Typography

Family: **SF Pro**

SF Pro via Font.system as the assigned type move: soft UI sizes, one larger title, no condensed display. Display is Remaining on the glass, short and wide, one or two lines, never above 34pt and never a condensed face. Body is 17pt remaining and capacity speech on conversation cards. Caption is Bare copy. At most six named steps behind one accessor; do not stack title3, callout, and subheadline as extra heroes. Weights carry hierarchy. No Font.custom and no fixedSize. Never below 12pt. Tabular figures for Remaining, Capacity, stitch totals, and ReloadMark counts through NumberFormatter. Dynamic Type; at AX5 Remaining may drop to title2 so it never clips; @ScaledMetric for the bobbin column. Day edges use Calendar.current.startOfDay then fold to Int YYYYMMDD.

Define a type scale of at most six steps behind one accessor and use only those
steps. Text stays legible at the largest Dynamic Type size.

### 7.3 Layout

- One base spacing unit (4 or 8 pt); only multiples of it.
- Corner radius and elevation are fixed by section 7.4, not chosen per screen.
- Every interactive element is at least 44x44 pt.

### 7.4 Component contract

Corner radius: **20pt** for cards, sheets and primary surfaces; **12pt** for chips, badges and small controls. Reach both through one accessor. Never a bare literal number, and never zero — a hard edge is not this app's design direction.

Elevation: **shadow** — a single soft drop-shadow token, reused everywhere a surface sits above another.

Primary control: **soft card** — primary actions live inside a rounded card using the radius below, not a flat row with no fill.

This is arithmetic, not a suggestion: every card, sheet, chip and button in this app uses these two radii and this elevation style. Do not introduce a second radius or a second elevation style.

### 7.5 Custom rendering scope

This app's `ui` axis is **SwiftUI pure · take metriccapacity**.

If that approach uses anything beyond stock SwiftUI/UIKit controls — `Canvas`, `CALayer`, Metal, SceneKit, SpriteKit, RealityKit, a hand-drawn `UIViewRepresentable`, or any other pixel-level custom rendering — confine it to exactly one hero surface on one screen (the mechanic's home view, or the one screen this axis exists to showcase). Every other screen — every list, every settings screen, every sheet, every secondary surface — is built from stock components: `List`, `Form`, `NavigationStack`, `TabView`, `Button`, `.sheet`, native `Text`/`Image`. A second custom-rendered surface elsewhere in the app is a defect, not a stylistic choice.

If **SwiftUI pure · take metriccapacity** is already fully native (no custom drawing layer), this section is satisfied automatically — there is nothing to confine.

The `ui` axis value is an implementation choice. It must never appear as a user-visible section title or label.

This assignment restates a catalog technique another app already holds. Write a new composition: new types, new layout, new motion. Do not copy source, file trees, or type names from the holder.

### 7.6 Taste DNA

Aesthetic: **editorial** (Editorial: measure, rules, type hierarchy, almost no boxes.)

Reference system: **intercom** — steal rhythm and restraint, not their colours or logos.

Mood: **rose**.

Home rhythm (`conversation`, airy): Soft header, conversation cards, a quiet input. Bubbles vary width.

Human chat cadence. Cards are speech, not a grid of twins. The composer is full width at the bottom.

Type move: Soft UI sizes, one larger title, no condensed display.

Motion (`quiet`): Almost no travel. Cross-fade 180ms ease-out. Numbers tick, they do not fly. Reduce Motion: instant swap.

Voice (`warm`): Human and brief. Empty states invite. Errors stay calm and useful.

Anti-slop from KNOWLEDGE.md applies. Taste never overrides contrast, 44pt hits, VoiceOver labels, or Reduce Motion.

---

## 8. UI and UX quality bar

Every item here is a defect if it is missing. Do not treat this as advice.

**Layout**

- Respect safe areas on every screen. Nothing sits under the notch, the Dynamic
  Island or the home indicator.
- The app is portrait-only on iPhone. Lock it in the Info settings and do not
  write rotation-dependent layout.
- No layout shift when asynchronous data arrives. Reserve the final size up
  front, or use a redacted placeholder of the same dimensions.
- Long product names must truncate gracefully, never push a number off screen.
  Numbers win; names truncate.
- Minimum tap target 44x44 pt for every interactive element, including small
  icon buttons and list accessories.
- Pick one base spacing unit and use only multiples of it. No arbitrary values.

**Keyboard**

- The grams field uses `.decimalPad`, and the decimal separator matches the
  user's locale.
- Content scrolls out from under the keyboard. The focused field is always
  visible.
- Tapping outside the field, or scrolling, dismisses the keyboard.
- Validate on the fly: reject negative and non-numeric input rather than
  crashing the parser later.

**Loading and state**

- Every asynchronous operation has a visible loading state.
- Guard against the spinner flash: if the work finishes in under 150 ms, do not
  show a spinner at all.
- Every list has a designed empty state containing a primary action, not just a
  sentence of text.
- Every error state offers a retry, and states plainly what failed.
- Disable the primary button while its action is in flight so it cannot be
  double-tapped into a double push or a duplicate entry.

**Typography and accessibility**

- All text scales with Dynamic Type. Verify at the largest accessibility size:
  nothing may clip or overlap.
- Every icon-only control has an `accessibilityLabel`. Decorative images are
  marked as decorative so VoiceOver skips them.
- Colour is never the only signal. Pair it with a label, a shape or an icon.
- Honour Reduce Motion: replace movement-heavy transitions with a fade.
- Meet contrast requirements against the palette in section 7. Check the muted
  colour against the background specifically; that is where these palettes fail.

**Formatting**

- Format every number with `NumberFormatter`, never string interpolation. Group
  separators and decimal separators must follow the locale.
- Energy is shown as a whole number of kcal. Macros are shown with at most one
  decimal place.
- Round only at the point of display. Stored values keep full precision.
- Day boundaries use `Calendar.current.startOfDay(for:)` in the user's current
  time zone. Handle the day changing while the app is open, and handle the
  short and long days that daylight saving produces.
- Unknown macro values render as a dash or the word "unknown", never as 0.

**Motion and feedback**

- One haptic on a successful commit (a food logged, a target saved). No haptic
  on navigation.
- Animations are short (0.2 to 0.35 s) and use a single shared easing curve.
- Nothing animates on first appearance of a screen except an intentional entry
  transition.

**Navigation**

- Back always works and never loses entered data without asking.
- A destructive action (delete a log row, reset all data) is confirmed.
- Modal sheets can always be dismissed; there is no dead end.
- Deep state is restorable: relaunching returns the user to a sane screen.


Every item here is a defect if it is missing. Section 7.4 fixed the numbers —
this is where they have to show up on screen.

**Hierarchy and density**

- Every screen has exactly one dominant element (a hero number, a canvas, a
  primary card) that the eye lands on first. A screen where every element has
  equal weight reads as a spreadsheet, not a product.
- Related content is grouped into a card or a section with the elevation
  style from 7.4, not left floating on the bare background.
- Unused flat background is not "minimal" — see the density rule in
  `KNOWLEDGE.md`. If a screen has room left after the mechanic and the
  content, add a secondary surface (a stat strip, a recent-activity card, a
  related-item row), not a `Spacer`.

**Components**

- Every card, sheet, chip, row and button in the app uses the corner radius
  and elevation from section 7.4. No screen introduces its own radius or its
  own shadow value "just for this one card".
- Buttons have a pressed state (`ButtonStyle` with a scale or opacity change
  on `isPressed`) and a disabled state that is visibly different, not just
  non-interactive.
- Chips and badges are pill or rounded-rect shaped per 7.4, never a bare
  `Text` with no background sitting where a control is expected.
- A functional control (add, filter, sort, close, more, share, delete) is an
  SF Symbol inside a properly hit-targeted `Button`. SF Symbols are fine and
  expected here — section 16 only bans them as the app's primary brand
  iconography (app icon, empty-state hero, onboarding art), which is what the
  generated assets in section 13 are for.

**Depth and material**

- At least one surface in the app (a sheet, a modal, a floating toolbar) uses
  the elevation style from 7.4 to visibly sit above the content behind it.
  A flat app with no depth anywhere reads as a wireframe.
- Icons and generated art sit on the surface colour from 7.1, never directly
  on a colour that makes their edges disappear.

**Motion as feedback, not decoration**

- The one dominant element in a screen (7.4's primary control, the mechanic's
  hero) responds visibly to touch: a scale, a colour shift, a haptic — pick
  at least one. A control that looks identical pressed and unpressed reads as
  broken, not calm.

**Taste DNA (section 7.6)**

- Home uses the assigned layout family and density. Three identical equal-weight
  cards, a leftover bento hole, or a second column structure copied down the
  page is a defect.
- Copy follows the assigned voice. No em-dash, no elevate/unlock/seamless, no
  emoji, no SECTION 01 labels.
- Motion follows the assigned personality and honours Reduce Motion with a fade.
  One signature motion per view. No glow stacked on glass stacked on spring.
- Tokens by intent: the live verb wears accent; delete does not wear primary.


---

## 9. Concurrency

The target builds with Swift 6.2 and `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete`. It
must compile with **zero concurrency warnings**. Warnings here become crashes
later, so they are not negotiable.

- All UI types are `@MainActor`. Annotate the type, not individual methods.
- Any value crossing an actor boundary is `Sendable`. Prefer immutable structs
  of primitives.
- Do not use `@unchecked Sendable`. If it is genuinely unavoidable, it needs a
  comment explaining what guarantees the safety.
- No mutable global state. No `static var` that is written after launch.
- Networking and storage APIs are `async` and honour cancellation. When the
  search query changes, cancel the in-flight task; do not let a stale response
  overwrite fresh results.
- Use structured concurrency. Avoid `Task.detached` unless there is a stated
  reason. Never fire a `Task` that outlives the view without owning it.
- Never use `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` to paper over an ordering problem.
  Fix the ordering.
- `Timer` and notification observers are invalidated in `deinit` or on
  disappear.


---

## 10. Persistence engineering

Chosen technology: **UserDefaults+Codable**

One Codable BobbinDocument (schemaVersion from 1, integer Capacity, integer Remaining, and per-day folds of Stitch, Bare, and ReloadMark with remainingBefore, keyed as Int YYYYMMDD) encoded to JSON Data in UserDefaults under pnb.bobbin.v1. Remaining is stored and is never Capacity. In-memory BobbinStore is the source of truth; UserDefaults is the projection. Debounce writes; flush when scenePhase becomes inactive or background; encode after every stitch, reload, retract, and Capacity edit. Editing Capacity clamps Remaining to min(Remaining, new Capacity) and does not auto-fill; only Reload restores Remaining to Capacity. Decoding failure falls back to Remaining equal to default Capacity with no writes, never a crash. resetAllData() is reachable from Settings. Simulator seed only once behind pnb.demo.v1 writes several Stitches so Remaining sits below Capacity, files ReloadMarks on more than one day, fills History and Charts, leaves Stitch enabled, marks onboarding complete, and never seeds Bare as the first frame. Never seed on a device. Views never touch UserDefaults.

This app persists to **files on disk**. The following are mandatory.

- Write atomically. Either `Data.write(to:options: .atomic)` or write to a
  temporary file and `FileManager.replaceItemAt`. A non-atomic write that is
  interrupted leaves a truncated file and the app will not launch.
- Create the containing directory with
  `withIntermediateDirectories: true` before the first write.
- Every document carries a `schemaVersion` field from version 1, and the decoder
  switches on it.
- Decoding failure must be recoverable: keep the previous good file as a
  `.backup`, fall back to it, and if that also fails start from empty state and
  tell the user. Never crash on a corrupt file.
- All file IO happens off the main thread. The main thread never blocks on disk.
- Debounce writes during rapid edits, but force a flush when `scenePhase`
  becomes `.inactive` or `.background`, and after any destructive action.
- Exclude caches from backup with `URLResourceValues.isExcludedFromBackup` where
  appropriate; user data belongs in Application Support and should be backed up.
- Keep an explicit in-memory source of truth and treat the file as a projection
  of it, so a failed write never leaves the UI showing data that does not exist.


Regardless of technology:

- One seam between domain logic and storage; the UI never touches storage types.
- Writes survive a force-quit. Do not rely on `applicationWillTerminate`.
- Provide `resetAllData()`, used by tests and reachable from Settings.

---

## 11. Networking

- One client type owns both Open Food Facts endpoints.
- Set `User-Agent` on every request. Open Food Facts throttles clients that do
  not identify themselves.
- 15 second timeout. One retry on a transient transport failure, then a typed
  error. Do not retry a 404.
- Cancel the in-flight search when the query changes. Debounce input by roughly
  300 ms.
- Decode into DTO types that mirror the JSON exactly, then map to domain types.
  Never decode straight into your domain model.
- Dedicated `JSONDecoder` with `.useDefaultKeys`. Never `convertFromSnakeCase` —
  Open Food Facts keys like `energy-kcal_100g` break snake_case conversion.
- Resolve a scanned code with `GET /api/v2/product/<barcode>.json`, not a search.
- Open Food Facts data is user-contributed and frequently incomplete. Every
  numeric field is optional. A product with no energy value is a normal case
  that the UI must present, not an error.
- Some numeric fields arrive as strings. The decoder must accept both a number
  and a numeric string for every nutriment.
- `status` of `0` in the product response means not found. Map it to a distinct
  error case so the UI can offer manual entry.
- Never crash on malformed JSON. A decoding failure is a handled error.
- Cache every resolved product locally on success, so the app degrades to a

## 11b. App Store readiness

The app must be submittable without further work.

- `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` in the target, declaring the UserDefaults access API
  reason `CA92.1` and the file timestamp reason `C617.1`, with
  `NSPrivacyTracking` false and no collected data types.
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO` in the pbxproj so TestFlight
  does not sit on Missing Compliance.
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` written specifically for this app. Generic strings
  get rejected.
- `LSApplicationCategoryType` of `public.app-category.healthcare-fitness`.
- Portrait only, iPhone and iPad (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2"`).
- No account, no sign-in, no delete-account flow, no in-app purchase, no ads, no
  user-generated content, and therefore no report or block UI.
- App Tracking Transparency is never invoked.
- The camera is the only sensitive permission requested.
- Guideline 5.1.1 (Privacy): do not encourage or direct the user to grant camera
  access. A pre-permission screen may exist, but the proceed button must be
  **Continue** or **Next** — never "Allow camera", "Enable camera",
  "Grant camera", or a bare Allow/Enable that calls `requestAccess`. The
  system dialog is the only Allow. Denied/restricted offers Open Settings.
- The app must not present itself as a clinician or as medical advice.
- Guideline 4.2 (Design — Minimum Functionality): the binary must be a native
  product, not a web browsing experience. No WKWebView / SFSafariViewController
  / UIWebView as home, a tab, or the primary UX. A content catalog, article
  reader, or site wrapper that could be a website is a reject. Push
  notifications, Core Location, and sharing do not make that acceptable.
- Guideline 1.4.1 (Safety — Physical Harm): if the binary shows health or
  medical recommendations, body-based targets, dosages, "you should" guidance,
  or product health claims (food, drink, supplement, remedy), put citations
  in the app. Tappable links to the sources, easy to find: same screen as the
  claim, or a Sources row one tap from Settings. Name the source (Open Food
  Facts, USDA FoodData Central, WHO, NIH MedlinePlus, …) and link it. A
  "not medical advice" footer without sources is a reject. A personal log
  that never advises does not invent claims to cite.
- Nutrition catalog data is credited to the database this app actually uses
  (Open Food Facts unless the spec names another). Credit is a tappable link,
  not a dead "OpenFoodFacts" label.


Ignore the food-log and Open Food Facts lines above when they conflict with this
family. Category for this app is `public.app-category.lifestyle`. Camera permission only if the
product actually captures.

Project settings that follow from the above:

```yaml
INFOPLIST_KEY_UIUserInterfaceStyle: Light
INFOPLIST_KEY_UISupportedInterfaceOrientations: UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait
INFOPLIST_KEY_UISupportedInterfaceOrientations_iPad: UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait
INFOPLIST_KEY_UIRequiresFullScreen: YES
INFOPLIST_KEY_ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: NO
INFOPLIST_KEY_LSApplicationCategoryType: public.app-category.lifestyle
TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: "1,2"
SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: complete

## 12. Functional twist: Stitch-then-reload (a Stitch spends 1 from Remaining; a Stitch at 0 writes Bare and Remaining stays 0; Reload writes a ReloadMark and restores Remaining to Capacity)

Home is stitch-the-bobbin on a locked glass bobbin, not a list of rows. A tap writes one Stitch and spends one from Remaining, which starts at Capacity. A tap at Remaining zero writes Bare and Remaining stays zero. Reload writes a ReloadMark and restores Remaining to Capacity; Reload while Remaining equals Capacity does nothing. Retract peels the last Stitch and restores one, or peels the last ReloadMark if that was the last write. There is no stitch-count field and no project-list field; Calendar counts ReloadMarks, Charts compare stitches to Capacity, and Settings sets integer Capacity.

This is the app's marketed differentiator. It must be:

- visible on the home screen, not buried in settings;
- backed by real persisted data, not a cosmetic flourish;
- covered by at least one unit test;
- described in the README as the reason a user would pick this app.

## 13. AI-generated assets

Art style: **3D glass render glassmorphism · take metriccapacity**


This assignment restates a catalog technique another app already holds. Write a new composition: new types, new layout, new motion. Do not copy source, file trees, or type names from the holder.

Base prompt, reused and extended for every asset:

```
3D glass render, frosted translucent glassmorphism, soft studio light, a home-sewing glass bobbin as a calm still life, remaining thread as a live inner column against the clear spool walls, refraction and milky frost, quiet product photography mood, isolated subjects, no readable text, no letters, no logo, no specified hues
```

All 12 images below are required. Generate each one, export
as PNG, and add it to `Assets.xcassets` as its own image set named exactly as
given. Every name carries the `pnb_` prefix.

### 13.1 App icon rules (strict)

The icon is rejected by App Store Connect if any of these are wrong:

- Exactly **1024 x 1024 px**.
- **No alpha channel.**
- sRGB colour profile, 8 bits per channel, PNG.
- **No text and no words** in the artwork.
- **No rounded corners and no built-in mask.**
- The subject stays inside the middle 80%.

### 13.2 Full asset list

| # | Image set | Size (px) | Alpha | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `pnb_AppIcon` | 1024x1024 | **NO** | App Store icon. NO alpha channel, NO transparency, NO text, NO rounded corners, NO drop shadow outside the canvas. |
| 2 | `pnb_Splash` | 1290x2796 | fill | Launch background. The middle third must stay quiet so the wordmark reads on top. |
| 3 | `pnb_Onboarding1` | 1024x1536 | **required cutout** | Onboarding page 1 illustration: what the app is for. |
| 4 | `pnb_Onboarding2` | 1024x1536 | **required cutout** | Onboarding page 2 illustration: the main verb. |
| 5 | `pnb_Onboarding3` | 1024x1536 | **required cutout** | Onboarding page 3 illustration: why they stay. |
| 6 | `pnb_EmptyHome` | 1024x1024 | **required cutout** | Empty state: the home screen has nothing yet. Calm and inviting, never sad. |
| 7 | `pnb_EmptyList` | 1024x1024 | **required cutout** | Empty state: a secondary list has no rows. |
| 8 | `pnb_CardBackdrop` | 1200x800 | fill | Backdrop art for a primary card. Low contrast so text stays readable. |
| 9 | `pnb_ControlFace` | 512x512 | **required cutout** | Custom control artwork used for the primary interactive element. |
| 10 | `pnb_TwistHero` | 1024x1024 | **required cutout** | Hero art for the 'Stitch-then-reload (a Stitch spends 1 from Remaining; a Stitch at 0 writes Bare and Remaining stays 0; Reload writes a ReloadMark and restores Remaining to Capacity)' feature screen. |
| 11 | `pnb_SuccessMark` | 512x512 | **required cutout** | Shown briefly when the primary action succeeds. |
| 12 | `pnb_HeaderDecor` | 1200x600 | **required cutout** | Decorative header accent on the main screen. |

### 13.3 Asset rules

- Cut-outs (everything except AppIcon, Splash, CardBackdrop): isolated subject,
  real PNG alpha, all four corners transparent. No square plate.
- Assets must be semantically different from each other.
- Record the exact prompt used for every asset in the README.
- SF Symbols are permitted only for close, chevron, share and similar system
  affordances.

Scanner frames, reticles, and seamless tiles are drawn in SwiftUI via `Path` or `Shape`. GenerateImage is not used for those. Every other in-app graphic (except AppIcon, Splash, CardBackdrop) is a **cutout**: isolated subject, real PNG alpha, all four corners transparent. An opaque square plate inside a circle or pentagon is a fail.

## 14. Demo data

Seed a small local demo dataset for this family's entities so Simulator
screenshots are not empty. The same seed must mark onboarding complete and
fill the primary surface — otherwise `-ReviewScreen` never fires. Never seed
on a physical device. Guard with `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)` and
`pnb.demo.v1`.

Seed the happy path: the home primary verb is enabled. The blocked / gated /
error state is a unit-test fixture, not Simulator home. Home chrome names the
job and the next tap in words a stranger knows. Axis values (`ui`, `naming`,
`architecture`) never become user-visible titles. A card that looks tappable
is a `Button`. A readout does not use button chrome.

---

## 16. Anti-patterns

The following will fail review:

- `try!`, `as!`, or force-unwrapping anything derived from the network, the
  database or a file.
- `fatalError` anywhere reachable at runtime. It is acceptable only for a
  programmer error in an initialiser that cannot fail in practice, and needs a
  comment.
- Swallowing an error with an empty `catch`.
- `print` used as production logging.
- A hard-coded hex colour outside the single colour accessor.
- A hard-coded font name outside the single typography accessor.
- An SF Symbol used as the app's brand iconography — the app icon, the
  empty-state hero, or onboarding art. Those come from section 13. SF Symbols
  are the right choice for every functional control (add, filter, sort,
  close, share, delete) — leaving those as bare text instead of a symbol is
  also a defect.
- Storing a value that can be computed (day totals, remaining budget, macro
  percentages).
- Blocking the main thread on disk or network work.
- `UIScreen.main` for sizing. Use the geometry the layout system gives you.
- Index positions used as list identity. Identity is a stable identifier.
- A view that reaches into the persistence layer directly, bypassing the
  architecture's designated seam.
- Business logic inside a `View` body or a `UIViewController` method, when the
  assigned architecture places it elsewhere.
- Copying a source file from another app in this batch.

## 17. Tests

Add a unit test target `PirnboxTests` covering at minimum:

1. The core domain invariant of this family (the thing that would be wrong if
   the calculator, decay, crate, or log lied).
2. Empty, populated and invalid input paths for the primary verb.
3. The section 12 twist logic.
4. One architecture-specific test proving the pattern holds.
5. A persistence round-trip: write, relaunch-equivalent reload, verify.
6. Parse `ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments` once after onboarding. 
   `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` switches the running app's live navigation.
   Cover that parser with a unit test. Do not host a `View` in the test.

---

## 18. README.md

Write `README.md` at the app folder root covering:

1. What the app does and who it is for.
2. The architecture used and **why** it suits this product.
3. The unique feature added and how it works.
4. The AI art style and the exact prompt used for every asset.
5. How this app differs from others in the batch.
6. Build instructions.

## 20. Build commands

```bash
cd Pirnbox
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme Pirnbox -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO build
xcrun simctl list devices available
xcodebuild -scheme Pirnbox -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<UDID>' test
```

Signing is off only on that command line. Do not put CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED, CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED, CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY or DEVELOPMENT_TEAM in project.yml — CI signs the archive. Leave CODE_SIGN_STYLE: Automatic as the scaffold set it. The exact simulator does not matter — use any available UDID from the list.
